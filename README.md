# KU-201-218-algorithm-and-programming

This is a remote repository to store my notes, assignments, and other stuffs during teaching Algorithm and Programming in ITK.

IMHO, this course is far from what is called algorithm. I would like to say that this course should be named "Introduction Programming with Python"
